## A website designed to teach interesting physical concepts at multiple levels

Physics education for advanced topics (quantum, black holes, relativity) does its best to explain concepts simply and
clearly. The problem I've noticed is that analogies are often utilized to do this, and anologies don't work forever.
Non-physicists I've met have understood the analogies well, and then started expanding on them until the similarities no
longer hold. This website is an attempt to tackle those topics just as simply at the lower levels, but without use of
analogies. The 4 levels of explanation are currently planned to be:

- **ELI5 (Explain like I'm five):** The easiest, least mathematical explanation of what's going on. The goal is to make
  it so that the reader walks away with _some_ understanding of how the concept actually functions behind the scenes,
  and not just the physics results involved.
- **Grade School:** A mildly mathematical approach to the concepts involved. If multiplication, division, and exponents
  are clear, then the explanations should be as well. This should leave the reader with some ability to re-derive the
  base concepts, if all goes well.
- **College:** Add in algebra and trigonometry, and things should be getting close to an actual physical exploration of
  the concepts involved. Calculus optional.
- **PhD:** No holds barred, all the math involved, but still focusing on the big takeaways instead of deriving
  everything from scratch.

The website is currently unhosted, until I'm satisfied with the product. Feel free to download the files and view it
yourself, but I'll post a link when it does finally get hosted.
